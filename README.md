# Emotion recognition from EEG signals #
## Introduction ##
This is the graduation thesis from Liang Tao, a fourth-year student at ITMO University.
## run ##
In order to run feature extraction you need to request the Seed Dataset, you need to apply for it, download the dataset and copy the SEED folder to the root directory.
Or you can also use the features already extracted in TrainData.

To run Model:

## Project Objectives ##
In this project we will use EEG signals for emotion recognition. Through different kinds of classifiers, analyze their accuracy and performance and draw conclusions.
After that, We will use the trained model to build the application.
## Experimental Equipment and Datasets ##
EEG Equipment: Open BCI 16 channels
Datasets: Seed
## Library Required ##
【NumPy】（https://numpy.org/）
【SciPy】（https://scipy.org/）
【scikit-learn】（https://scikit-learn.org/stable/）
【matplotlib】（https://matplotlib.org/）
For running Application, you may need to install extra package:

For Window you need to check in the Python install the optional feature

``` tcl/tk and IDLE ```

while installing python.
For mac you need to install python-tk:

``` brew install python-tk@(Your python version) ```
